# Actorbase

Actorbase is a key-value NoSQL database based on the actor model.


## About

Actorbase guarantees a high level of scalability, resilience and performance. It allows you to manage easily and flexibly your data, using the main advantages offered by the actor model, in order to support the development of modern and performing applications.

The program is composed by three main components:

* Actorbase client
* Actorbase server
* Actorbase driver (for Scala)

Actorbase is developed using [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) as programming language, and the [Akka](http://akka.io/) library for the actor system logic.


## Installation & Usage

Actorbase runs on JVM, therefore you just have to make the ```
jar
``` files from the source and run them.

To properly run the program you must have installed Java 8 or newer on your pc.

All the documentation related to the project can be found at [ActorbaseDoc](https://github.com/SweeneyThreads/ActorbaseDoc).


## Licence

The project is developed by [SWEeneyThreads](https://github.com/SweeneyThreads) and is completely open-source, the code and the documentation are distributend under the MIT license.
